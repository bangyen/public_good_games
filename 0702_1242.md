- about the WF one
- could just take the code from previous one
- this is so easy, that I might as well write from scratch, will take less time
- how does this work?
  - it's actually not clear what the dynamics are here
  - is this really two level?
    - I don't think so, it's just one level, but we keep track of groups
    - and that's important because payoffs depend on groups
- not clear at all, need imput from pFan here
