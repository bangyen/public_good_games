- general question about how do we simulate CTMC
- Let's solve a simpler one: one group, two players, rates `r_1`, `r_2`
- offspring also reproduces, reproduction is cloning
- Poisson is saying probability of an event happening at a time interval, so do those
  - similar to integration by Riemman sums
- how would you simulate a general CTMC? just do that
- make a transition, figure out new rates, make the next transition
- ok, what's the architecture?
  - do we just have individuals with attributes? do we have groups?
  - do we keep track of individuals? or just the ball urn game?
  - computational complexity vs additional insights
- I like having groups, even if there is redundance of code, it's more readable
- so, the game has a bunch of groups
- each group has a bunch of individuals
- there's probably redundance of code in having individuals
  - it's not super necessary for running the game, but they could keep track of their own statistics,
  - and their own type, that's important.
